## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a potential security issue, please report it responsibly.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, discussions, or pull requests.**

Instead, use one of the following methods:

- GitHub Security Advisories (preferred)
- Email the maintainers directly (if a security contact is listed in the repository)

When reporting a vulnerability, please include as much information as possible, such as:

- A clear description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce the vulnerability
- Affected versions
- Potential impact
- Any known mitigations or workarounds
- Proof-of-concept code (if available)

## Disclosure Process

Once a vulnerability is reported, the maintainers will:

1. Acknowledge receipt of the report within a reasonable timeframe.
2. Assess the severity and scope of the issue.
3. Work on a fix or mitigation strategy.
4. Prepare a security release if required.
5. Publicly disclose the vulnerability once a fix is available, giving appropriate credit to the reporter (if desired).

Timelines for resolution may vary depending on the complexity and severity of the issue.

## Security Updates

Security fixes will be released as soon as reasonably possible. Updates may include:

- Patch releases
- Minor or major version updates (if required)

Users are responsible for keeping their dependencies and deployments up to date.
