<h1>RMS Residual in MPCORB</h1>

<h2>1. Conceptual Definition</h2>
<p>
The <strong>RMS residual</strong> (root-mean-square residual) is a statistical quality
metric used in the <strong>MPCORB</strong> catalog to quantify how well a computed orbit
fits the available astrometric observations of a minor planet.
</p>

<p>
It provides a single scalar measure of the typical deviation between observed and
calculated positions.
</p>

<h2>2. Residuals in Astrometric Orbit Determination</h2>
<p>
In orbit determination, each astrometric observation yields a residual defined as the
difference between the observed and computed sky position of the object.
</p>

<p>
Residuals are usually expressed in angular units (arcseconds) and may be considered
separately in right ascension and declination.
</p>

<h2>3. Mathematical Definition</h2>
<p>
For a set of <em>N</em> observations with residuals <em>&Delta;&theta;<sub>i</sub></em>, the RMS
residual is defined as:
</p>

<span class="formula">
RMS = &#8730;( (1/N) &Sigma; (&Delta;&theta;<sub>i</sub>)&sup2; )
</span>

<p>
where the summation runs over all observations included in the orbit solution.
</p>

<h2>4. Interpretation of the RMS Residual</h2>
<p>
The RMS residual represents the typical magnitude of the astrometric error after orbit
fitting. A smaller RMS value indicates a better fit between the computed orbit and the
observations.
</p>

<p>
In MPCORB, RMS values are usually given in <strong>arcseconds</strong>.
</p>

<h2>5. Typical RMS Values in MPCORB</h2>

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>RMS (arcsec)</th>
        <th>Interpretation</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>&lt; 0.3</td>
        <td>Excellent orbit fit</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>0.3 &ndash; 0.6</td>
        <td>Good orbit fit</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>&gt; 1.0</td>
        <td>Poor or uncertain orbit</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<h2>6. Factors Influencing RMS Residuals</h2>
<p>
Several factors affect the RMS residual reported in MPCORB:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Number of observations</li>
    <li>Astrometric precision of observatories</li>
    <li>Observation time span (arc length)</li>
    <li>Weighting schemes used in orbit determination</li>
    <li>Unmodeled perturbations or non-gravitational effects</li>
</ul>

<h2>7. Limitations of the RMS Metric</h2>
<p>
The RMS residual is a global summary statistic and does not capture:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Systematic biases in observations</li>
    <li>Uneven distribution of residuals</li>
    <li>Correlations between residual components</li>
</ul>

<div class="note">
A low RMS value does not guarantee a dynamically accurate long-term orbit, especially
for short observational arcs.
</div>

<h2>8. Role in MPCORB and Orbit Assessment</h2>
<p>
Within MPCORB, the RMS residual serves as a quick indicator of orbit quality and
observational consistency. It is frequently used to:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Assess reliability of orbital elements</li>
    <li>Compare competing orbit solutions</li>
    <li>Select objects for follow-up observations</li>
</ul>

<h2>9. Concise Scientific Definition</h2>
<p>
<strong>The RMS residual</strong> in MPCORB is the root-mean-square of the astrometric
differences between observed and computed positions of a minor planet. It provides a
compact quantitative measure of the goodness-of-fit of the orbital solution.
