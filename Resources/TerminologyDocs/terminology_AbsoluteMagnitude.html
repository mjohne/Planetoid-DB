<h1>Absolute Magnitude</h1>

<h2>1. Conceptual Definition</h2>
<p>
<strong>Absolute magnitude</strong> is a fundamental quantitative measure in
<strong>astronomy and astrophysics</strong> that describes the intrinsic brightness
(luminosity) of an astronomical object, independent of its distance from the observer.
</p>

<p>
It provides a standardized brightness scale that allows direct comparison of the
true luminous output of stars, planets, asteroids, and other celestial bodies.
</p>

<h2>2. Definition for Stars</h2>
<p>
For stellar astronomy, the absolute magnitude <strong>M</strong> is defined as:
</p>

<div class="note">
The apparent magnitude a star would have if it were located at a distance of exactly
<strong>10 parsecs</strong> from the observer, with no interstellar extinction.
</div>

<p>
This definition removes the effect of distance and isolates the intrinsic radiative
power of the star.
</p>

<h2>3. Relation to Apparent Magnitude</h2>
<p>
The relationship between apparent magnitude <em>m</em>, absolute magnitude <em>M</em>,
and distance <em>d</em> (in parsecs) is given by the <strong>distance modulus</strong>:
</p>

<span class="formula">
M = m − 5 log<sub>10</sub>(d / 10)
</span>

<p>
or equivalently:
</p>

<span class="formula">
m − M = 5 log<sub>10</sub>(d) − 5
</span>

<h2>4. Physical Interpretation</h2>
<p>
Absolute magnitude is a logarithmic measure of luminosity. A difference of
<strong>5 magnitudes</strong> corresponds to a factor of exactly
<strong>100</strong> in received flux.
</p>

<p>
Thus, a difference of one magnitude corresponds to a brightness ratio of:
</p>

<span class="formula">
2.512 ≈ 100<sup>1/5</sup>
</span>

<h2>5. Absolute Magnitude in the Solar System</h2>
<p>
For Solar System objects such as asteroids and comets, a different definition is used.
The absolute magnitude <strong>H</strong> is defined as:
</p>

<div class="note">
The apparent magnitude the object would have if it were located
<strong>1 astronomical unit (AU)</strong> from both the Sun and the observer, and observed
at zero phase angle.
</div>

<p>
This definition is particularly important in planetary science and small-body dynamics.
</p>

<h2>6. Relation to Size and Albedo</h2>
<p>
For asteroids, the absolute magnitude <em>H</em> is related to the effective diameter
<em>D</em> and geometric albedo <em>p</em> by:
</p>

<span class="formula">
D (km) = 1329 × 10<sup>−H/5</sup> / √p
</span>

<p>
This relation shows that absolute magnitude alone does not uniquely determine size;
surface reflectivity must also be known.
</p>

<h2>7. Wavelength Dependence</h2>
<p>
Absolute magnitude is defined for specific photometric bands (e.g., V, B, R, infrared).
The quoted value must always specify the observational bandpass.
</p>

<p>
Different bands probe different physical properties, such as temperature, composition,
and surface characteristics.
</p>

<h2>8. Applications</h2>
<p>
Absolute magnitude is widely used in:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Stellar classification and Hertzsprung–Russell diagrams</li>
    <li>Distance determination and cosmological studies</li>
    <li>Asteroid catalogs and impact risk assessment</li>
    <li>Exoplanet and minor-body population statistics</li>
</ul>

<h2>9. Concise Scientific Definition</h2>
<p>
<strong>Absolute magnitude</strong> is a standardized logarithmic measure of the intrinsic
brightness of an astronomical object. For stars, it is defined as the apparent magnitude
at a distance of 10 parsecs; for Solar System objects, it is defined at unit heliocentric
and observer distance with zero phase angle.
