<h1>Directrix</h1>

<h2>1. Conceptual Definition</h2>
<p>
The <strong>directrix</strong> is a fundamental geometric concept associated with
<strong>conic sections</strong>. It is a fixed straight line used, together with a
focus, to define the shape and properties of a conic.
</p>

<p>
In both analytic geometry and celestial mechanics, the directrix provides an
alternative but fully equivalent description of conic curves such as ellipses,
parabolas, and hyperbolas.
</p>

<h2>2. Focus–Directrix Definition of Conic Sections</h2>
<p>
A conic section is defined as the set of all points for which the ratio of the
distance to a fixed point (the <strong>focus</strong>) and the distance to a fixed line
(the <strong>directrix</strong>) is constant.
</p>

<span class="formula">
|PF| / |PD| = e
</span>

<p>
where:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><em>P</em> is any point on the conic</li>
    <li><em>F</em> is the focus</li>
    <li><em>D</em> is the directrix</li>
    <li><em>e</em> is the eccentricity</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Classification of Conics Using the Directrix</h2>

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Eccentricity</th>
        <th>Conic Type</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>0 &le; e &lt; 1</td>
        <td>Ellipse</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>e = 1</td>
        <td>Parabola</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>e &gt; 1</td>
        <td>Hyperbola</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>
Thus, the directrix plays a central role in the unifying geometric definition of all
Keplerian orbits.
</p>

<h2>4. Directrix in Orbital Mechanics</h2>
<p>
In celestial mechanics, one focus of the orbit is occupied by the central gravitating
body. The corresponding directrix is a hypothetical reference line that allows the
orbital equation to be written in compact polar form:
</p>

<span class="formula">
r(&nu;) = p / (1 + e cos &nu;)
</span>

<p>
The directrix does not correspond to a physical object but provides a precise geometric
reference associated with the orbit.
</p>

<h2>5. Geometric Interpretation</h2>
<p>
The directrix is always perpendicular to the major axis of the conic and located at a
distance from the focus that depends on the eccentricity and focal parameter.
</p>

<p>
For an ellipse, the directrix lies outside the curve; for a hyperbola, it lies between
the branches.
</p>

<h2>6. Relation to the Focal Parameter</h2>
<p>
The distance from the focus to the directrix is given by:
</p>

<span class="formula">
d = p / e
</span>

<p>
where <em>p</em> is the focal parameter (semi-latus rectum).
</p>

<h2>7. Physical Interpretation</h2>
<p>
Although the directrix has no physical manifestation in orbital motion, it provides a
powerful conceptual tool for understanding how eccentricity controls the shape of an
orbit.
</p>

<p>
It emphasizes that Keplerian orbits are purely geometric consequences of inverse-square
central forces.
</p>

<h2>8. Applications</h2>
<p>
The directrix is used in:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Analytic geometry of conic sections</li>
    <li>Derivations of Keplerian orbit equations</li>
    <li>Educational explanations of eccentricity</li>
    <li>Unifying treatments of bound and unbound orbits</li>
</ul>

<h2>9. Concise Scientific Definition</h2>
<p>
<strong>The directrix</strong> is a fixed straight line used in the focus–directrix
definition of conic sections. A conic is the locus of points whose distance ratio to a
focus and to the directrix is constant and equal to the eccentricity.
