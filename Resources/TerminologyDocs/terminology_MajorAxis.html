<h1>Major Axis</h1>

<h2>1. Geometrical Definition</h2>
<p>
The <strong>major axis</strong> is a fundamental geometric concept associated with conic sections, in particular
with the <strong>ellipse</strong> and the <strong>ellipsoid</strong>. In the planar case of an ellipse, the major
axis is defined as the <em>longest straight line segment</em> that passes through the center of the figure and
connects the two points of maximum separation on the boundary.
</p>

<p>
The endpoints of the major axis are referred to as the <strong>vertices</strong> of the ellipse. The midpoint of
the major axis coincides with the geometric center of the ellipse.
</p>

<h2>2. Relation to Semi-Axes</h2>
<p>
Let an ellipse be characterized by:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><em>a</em>: the <strong>semi major axis</strong></li>
    <li><em>b</em>: the <strong>semi minor axis</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>
The total length of the major axis is therefore:
</p>

<span class="formula">
Major axis length = 2a
</span>

<p>
The major axis is orthogonal to the minor axis and defines the principal direction of elongation of the ellipse.
</p>

<h2>3. Mathematical Description</h2>

<h3>3.1 Ellipse in Cartesian Coordinates</h3>
<p>
For an ellipse centered at the origin and aligned with the coordinate axes, the standard equation is:
</p>

<span class="formula">
(x² / a²) + (y² / b²) = 1
</span>

<p>
In this representation, the major axis lies along the axis associated with the larger denominator (<em>a²</em>),
indicating the direction of maximum extent.
</p>

<h3>3.2 Relation to Foci and Eccentricity</h3>
<p>
The two foci of an ellipse are located symmetrically along the major axis. If <em>c</em> denotes the distance from
the center to either focus, then:
</p>

<span class="formula">
c = √(a² − b²)
</span>

<p>
The <strong>eccentricity</strong> <em>e</em> is defined as:
</p>

<span class="formula">
e = c / a
</span>

<p>
Thus, the major axis determines both the focal separation and the overall scale of the ellipse.
</p>

<h2>4. Physical Significance in Celestial Mechanics</h2>

<h3>4.1 Keplerian Orbits</h3>
<p>
In classical celestial mechanics, the orbit of a body in a bound two-body system is an ellipse with the central
mass located at one focus. The major axis of the orbital ellipse represents the direction of maximum radial
excursion between the periapsis and apoapsis.
</p>

<p>
The length of the major axis is given by:
</p>

<span class="formula">
Major axis = r<sub>periapsis</sub> + r<sub>apoapsis</sub>
</span>

<p>
where:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><em>r<sub>periapsis</sub></em> is the minimum orbital distance</li>
    <li><em>r<sub>apoapsis</sub></em> is the maximum orbital distance</li>
</ul>

<h3>4.2 Energetic Interpretation</h3>
<p>
Although the major axis itself is a geometric quantity, it is directly related to the orbital energy through the
semi major axis <em>a</em>. Since the major axis equals <em>2a</em>, it indirectly reflects the total mechanical
energy of the orbit.
</p>

    </tr>

<h2>6. Applications</h2>
<p>
The concept of the major axis appears in numerous scientific and technical fields, including:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Analytical geometry and linear algebra</li>
    <li>Astrodynamics and orbital mechanics</li>
    <li>Geodesy and planetary reference ellipsoids</li>
    <li>Physics of bound dynamical systems</li>
</ul>

<h2>7. Concise Scientific Definition</h2>
<p>
<strong>The major axis</strong> of an ellipse is the longest line segment passing through its center and connecting
the two most distant points on the curve. Its length equals twice the semi major axis and defines the principal
direction and maximum spatial extent of the figure.
