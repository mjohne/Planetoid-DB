<h1>Semi Minor Axis</h1>

<h2>1. Geometrical Definition</h2>
<p>
The <strong>semi minor axis</strong>, commonly denoted by the symbol <em>b</em>, is a fundamental geometric parameter
of an <strong>ellipse</strong>. An ellipse is defined as the locus of all points in a plane for which the sum of the
distances to two fixed points, called the <em>foci</em>, is constant.
</p>

<p>
An ellipse possesses two mutually perpendicular principal axes:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Semi major axis (<em>a</em>)</strong>: half of the longest diameter of the ellipse</li>
    <li><strong>Semi minor axis (<em>b</em>)</strong>: half of the shortest diameter of the ellipse</li>
</ul>

<p>
The semi minor axis is oriented perpendicular to the semi major axis and passes through the center of the ellipse.
By definition, its magnitude satisfies:
</p>

<span class="formula">b ≤ a</span>

<h2>2. Mathematical Formulation</h2>

<h3>2.1 Cartesian Equation of an Ellipse</h3>
<p>
For an ellipse centered at the origin and aligned with the coordinate axes, the standard Cartesian equation is:
</p>

<span class="formula">
(x² / a²) + (y² / b²) = 1
</span>

<p>
Here, the semi minor axis <em>b</em> determines the maximum extent of the ellipse along the axis orthogonal to the
semi major axis.
</p>

<h3>2.2 Relation to Focal Distance and Eccentricity</h3>
<p>
Let <em>c</em> be the distance from the center of the ellipse to either focus. The geometric relationship between
<em>a</em>, <em>b</em>, and <em>c</em> is given by:
</p>

<span class="formula">
c = √(a² − b²)
</span>

<p>
The <strong>eccentricity</strong> <em>e</em> of the ellipse is defined as:
</p>

<span class="formula">
e = c / a
</span>

<p>
Combining these relations yields a direct expression for the semi minor axis:
</p>

<span class="formula">
b = a √(1 − e²)
</span>

<p>
This equation demonstrates that the semi minor axis is uniquely determined by the semi major axis and the
eccentricity.
</p>

<h2>3. Physical Significance in Celestial Mechanics</h2>

<h3>3.1 Keplerian Orbits</h3>
<p>
In classical celestial mechanics, the orbit of a body under a central inverse-square force (the two-body problem)
is a conic section. For bound orbits, this conic section is an ellipse, with the central mass located at one focus.
</p>

<p>
In this context:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>The semi major axis <em>a</em> defines the overall size and orbital energy</li>
    <li>The semi minor axis <em>b</em> characterizes the transverse extent of the orbit</li>
</ul>

<p>
The semi minor axis is not an independent orbital element but is derived from <em>a</em> and <em>e</em> via:
</p>

<span class="formula">
b = a √(1 − e²)
</span>

<h3>3.2 Orbital Area and Kepler’s Second Law</h3>
<p>
The area <em>A</em> of an elliptical orbit is given by:
</p>

<span class="formula">
A = π a b
</span>

<p>
This area is directly related to Kepler’s second law, which states that a line connecting the orbiting body to the
central mass sweeps out equal areas in equal times.
</p>

<h2>5. Applications</h2>
<p>
The semi minor axis appears in numerous scientific and technical disciplines, including:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Astrodynamics and orbital mechanics</li>
    <li>Geodesy and reference ellipsoids of planetary bodies</li>
    <li>Physics of bound dynamical systems</li>
    <li>Statistics (e.g., covariance and confidence ellipses)</li>
</ul>

<h2>6. Concise Scientific Definition</h2>
<p>
<strong>The semi minor axis</strong> is defined as half the length of the shorter principal axis of an ellipse. It
represents the maximum radial extent of the ellipse perpendicular to the semi major axis and is mathematically
expressed as:
</p>

<span class="formula">
b = a √(1 − e²)
