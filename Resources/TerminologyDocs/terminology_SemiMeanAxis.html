<h1>Semi-Mean Axis</h1>

<h2>1. Terminological Clarification</h2>
<p>
The term <strong>semi-mean axis</strong> is <em>not</em> a formally standardized geometric or orbital element in
classical mathematics or celestial mechanics. However, it appears in some scientific, historical, and applied
contexts as a <strong>derived characteristic length</strong> of an ellipse, intended to represent an averaged
measure between the semi major and semi minor axes.
</p>

<div class="note">
<strong>Important:</strong> The semi-mean axis must be clearly distinguished from the
<strong>semi major axis</strong>, which is a fundamental and rigorously defined orbital element. The semi-mean
axis is a secondary, derived quantity and is not used in Kepler&rsquo;s laws or standard orbital element sets.
</div>

<h2>2. Definition in Elliptical Geometry</h2>
<p>
Let an ellipse be defined by:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Semi major axis: <em>a</em></li>
    <li>Semi minor axis: <em>b</em></li>
</ul>

<p>
The <strong>semi-mean axis</strong>, usually denoted here by <em>a<sub>m</sub></em>, is most commonly defined as the
<strong>geometric mean</strong> of the two principal semi-axes:
</p>

<span class="formula">
a<sub>m</sub> = &#8730;(a &middot; b)
</span>

<p>
This definition yields a single characteristic length scale that lies between <em>b</em> and <em>a</em> and is
invariant under exchange of the two axes.
</p>

<h2>3. Mathematical Properties</h2>
<p>
The semi-mean axis satisfies the inequality:
</p>

<span class="formula">
b &le; &#8730;(a &middot; b) &le; a
</span>

<p>
Equality holds only in the circular limit (<em>a = b</em>). In that case:
</p>

<span class="formula">
a<sub>m</sub> = a = b
</span>

<p>
Using the eccentricity <em>e</em> of the ellipse, where:
</p>

<span class="formula">
b = a &#8730;(1 &minus; e&sup2;)
</span>

<p>
the semi-mean axis may also be written as:
</p>

<span class="formula">
a<sub>m</sub> = a (1 &minus; e&sup2;)<sup>1/4</sup>
</span>

<h2>4. Relation to Area and Equivalent Circles</h2>
<p>
The area <em>A</em> of an ellipse is:
</p>

<span class="formula">
A = &pi; a b
</span>

<p>
Defining a circle with the same area as the ellipse yields an equivalent radius <em>r<sub>eq</sub></em>:
</p>

<span class="formula">
r<sub>eq</sub> = &#8730;(a b)
</span>

<p>
Thus, the semi-mean axis corresponds exactly to the radius of a circle having the same area as the ellipse. This
interpretation is often the primary motivation for introducing this quantity.
</p>

<h2>5. Use in Physics and Applied Sciences</h2>
<p>
While not part of the canonical orbital elements, the semi-mean axis is occasionally used in:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Analytical approximations involving elliptical cross-sections</li>
    <li>Geophysics and geodesy for equivalent-radius representations</li>
    <li>Engineering problems involving averaged curvature or scaling laws</li>
    <li>Statistical analysis of covariance ellipses</li>
</ul>

<p>
In celestial mechanics, the term <em>mean distance</em> is sometimes informally used to refer to the semi major
axis. This should <strong>not</strong> be confused with the semi-mean axis defined here.
</p>

<h2>7. Concise Scientific Definition</h2>
<p>
<strong>The semi-mean axis</strong> is a derived characteristic length of an ellipse, defined as the geometric mean
of the semi major and semi minor axes:
</p>

<span class="formula">
a<sub>m</sub> = &#8730;(a &middot; b)
</span>

<p>
It represents the radius of a circle with the same area as the ellipse and serves as an averaged geometric measure
in analytical and applied contexts.
