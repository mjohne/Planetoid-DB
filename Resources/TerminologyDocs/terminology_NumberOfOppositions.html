<h1>Number of Oppositions in MPCORB</h1>

<h2>1. Conceptual Definition</h2>
<p>
In the context of the <strong>MPCORB</strong> catalog, the <strong>number of oppositions</strong>
is an integer quantity indicating how many distinct orbital apparitions of a minor planet
have been observed and successfully linked in the determination of its orbit.
</p>

<p>
It is a discrete measure of long-term observational coverage and orbit confirmation.
</p>

<h2>2. Astronomical Meaning of an Opposition</h2>
<p>
An <strong>opposition</strong> occurs when a Solar System body is observed at a solar
elongation of approximately 180&deg;, placing it opposite the Sun in the sky as seen from
Earth.
</p>

<p>
At opposition, a minor planet is typically:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Closest to Earth</li>
    <li>Brightest and easiest to observe</li>
    <li>Observable over long nightly arcs</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Definition of Number of Oppositions</h2>
<p>
The number of oppositions counts how many <em>distinct observing seasons</em>, separated
by at least one synodic period, have contributed astrometric data to the orbit solution.
</p>

<p>
Observations within a single apparition count as <strong>one opposition</strong>, even if
many measurements are obtained.
</p>

<h2>4. Representation in MPCORB</h2>
<p>
In MPCORB, the number of oppositions is typically given as a small integer:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>1 &ndash; single-opposition object</li>
    <li>2&ndash;3 &ndash; moderately well-established orbit</li>
    <li>&ge; 4 &ndash; well-observed, long-arc object</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Scientific Significance</h2>
<p>
The number of oppositions is one of the strongest qualitative indicators of orbital
reliability. Each additional opposition:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Reduces orbital element degeneracies</li>
    <li>Improves determination of mean motion</li>
    <li>Stabilizes long-term ephemeris predictions</li>
</ul>

<div class="note">
A single-opposition orbit may have a low RMS residual but still be highly uncertain when
propagated far from the observation interval.
</div>

<h2>6. Relation to Observation Span</h2>
<p>
While the observation span measures the total temporal extent of observations, the
number of oppositions captures the <strong>seasonal repetition</strong> of successful
recovery.
</p>

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Metric</th>
        <th>Primary Meaning</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Observation span</td>
        <td>Total time baseline</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Number of oppositions</td>
        <td>Number of linked apparitions</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<h2>7. Limitations</h2>
<p>
The number of oppositions does not directly reflect:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Astrometric precision</li>
    <li>Distribution of observations within each apparition</li>
    <li>Quality of individual measurements</li>
</ul>

<p>
It must therefore be interpreted together with RMS residuals and observation span.
</p>

<h2>8. Practical Applications</h2>
<p>
The number of oppositions is used to:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Assess orbit confirmation status</li>
    <li>Prioritize recovery and follow-up observations</li>
    <li>Identify potentially lost or poorly constrained objects</li>
    <li>Classify single- vs. multi-opposition objects</li>
</ul>

<h2>9. Concise Scientific Definition</h2>
<p>
<strong>The number of oppositions</strong> in MPCORB is the count of distinct observing
apparitions at opposition that have contributed astrometric data to an orbital solution.
It provides a discrete measure of long-term orbit confirmation and predictive stability.
