<h1>Observation Span in MPCORB</h1>

<h2>1. Conceptual Definition</h2>
<p>
In the context of the <strong>MPCORB</strong> catalog, the <strong>observation span</strong>
describes the total time interval over which astrometric observations of a minor planet
have been collected and used to determine its orbit.
</p>

<p>
It is a temporal measure of observational coverage and is one of the most important
indicators of orbital reliability.
</p>

<h2>2. Formal Definition</h2>
<p>
The observation span is defined as the elapsed time between the <em>earliest</em> and
<em>latest</em> accepted astrometric observations included in the orbit solution:
</p>

<span class="formula">
Observation span = t<sub>last</sub> &minus; t<sub>first</sub>
</span>

<p>
It is typically expressed in units of days, months, or years.
</p>

<h2>3. Representation in MPCORB</h2>
<p>
In MPCORB, the observation span is commonly presented in a compact textual form such as:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><em>1998&ndash;2024</em></li>
    <li><em>2015&ndash;2015</em> (single-opposition orbit)</li>
</ul>

<p>
This notation provides a quick overview of the temporal extent of the data set.
</p>

<h2>4. Scientific Significance</h2>
<p>
The observation span is a key determinant of orbit quality. Longer spans:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Reduce uncertainties in orbital elements</li>
    <li>Improve prediction accuracy</li>
    <li>Stabilize long-term dynamical behavior</li>
</ul>

<p>
Short observation spans, especially those covering a single apparition, often lead to
poorly constrained orbits.
</p>

<h2>5. Relation to Orbit Determination</h2>
<p>
Orbit determination is fundamentally an inverse problem. A longer observation span
provides stronger constraints on:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Semi-major axis</li>
    <li>Eccentricity</li>
    <li>Mean motion and period</li>
</ul>

<div class="note">
A large number of observations within a very short time span cannot compensate for a
lack of long-term temporal coverage.
</div>

<h2>6. Observation Span vs. Number of Observations</h2>
<p>
The observation span must be distinguished from the total number of observations:
</p>

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Metric</th>
        <th>Meaning</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Observation span</td>
        <td>Temporal extent of data</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Number of observations</td>
        <td>Sampling density</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>
Both metrics are complementary and should be considered jointly.
</p>

<h2>7. Relation to RMS Residual</h2>
<p>
While the RMS residual measures how well the orbit fits the existing data, the
observation span determines how well the orbit extrapolates beyond the observation
interval.
</p>

<p>
A low RMS residual combined with a short observation span may still indicate a highly
uncertain future orbit.
</p>

<h2>8. Practical Applications</h2>
<p>
The observation span is used in:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Assessing the reliability of MPCORB orbital elements</li>
    <li>Prioritizing objects for follow-up observations</li>
    <li>Identifying long-arc versus single-opposition objects</li>
    <li>Long-term dynamical and impact risk studies</li>
</ul>

<h2>9. Concise Scientific Definition</h2>
<p>
<strong>The observation span</strong> in MPCORB is the time interval between the first and
last astrometric observations used in an orbital solution. It quantifies the temporal
coverage of the data set and is a primary indicator of orbital robustness and predictive
reliability.
