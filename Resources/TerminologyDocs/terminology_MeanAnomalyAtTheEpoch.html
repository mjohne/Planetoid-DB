<h1>Mean Anomaly at the Epoch</h1>

<h2>1. Conceptual Definition</h2>
<p>
The <strong>mean anomaly at the epoch</strong> is a fundamental angular parameter in
<strong>celestial mechanics</strong> that specifies the position of an orbiting body
along its Keplerian orbit at a specified reference time known as the
<strong>epoch</strong>.
</p>

<p>
It is one of the classical Keplerian orbital elements and serves as the temporal
reference from which the future (or past) position of the body can be propagated.
</p>

<h2>2. Mean Anomaly</h2>
<p>
The <strong>mean anomaly</strong>, usually denoted by <strong>M</strong>, is an auxiliary
angle that increases linearly with time for unperturbed Keplerian motion. It is defined
by:
</p>

<span class="formula">
M = n (t − τ)
</span>

<p>
where:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><em>n</em> is the mean motion</li>
    <li><em>t</em> is time</li>
    <li><em>τ</em> is the time of perihelion passage</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Definition of the Epoch</h2>
<p>
The <strong>epoch</strong> is a specified reference instant in time at which the orbital
elements are defined. Commonly used epochs include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Julian Date (e.g., J2000.0)</li>
    <li>Barycentric Dynamical Time (TDB)</li>
    <li>Terrestrial Time (TT)</li>
</ul>

<p>
Orbital elements, including the mean anomaly, are strictly valid only at their
associated epoch.
</p>

<h2>4. Mean Anomaly at the Epoch</h2>
<p>
The <strong>mean anomaly at the epoch</strong>, usually denoted by <strong>M₀</strong>,
is the value of the mean anomaly evaluated at the epoch time <em>t₀</em>:
</p>

<span class="formula">
M₀ = M(t₀)
</span>

<p>
Equivalently, it may be expressed as:
</p>

<span class="formula">
M₀ = n (t₀ − τ)
</span>

<p>
This quantity fixes the phase of the orbit at the reference time.
</p>

<h2>5. Relation to Orbital Propagation</h2>
<p>
Once the mean anomaly at the epoch is known, the mean anomaly at any later time <em>t</em>
is obtained by:
</p>

<span class="formula">
M(t) = M₀ + n (t − t₀)
</span>

<p>
This linear relation is the basis for orbit propagation in the two-body approximation.
</p>

<h2>6. Connection to Eccentric and True Anomalies</h2>
<p>
The mean anomaly at the epoch is converted to the eccentric anomaly <em>E</em> by solving
<strong>Kepler’s equation</strong>:
</p>

<span class="formula">
M = E − e sin E
</span>

<p>
The eccentric anomaly is then transformed into the true anomaly <em>ν</em>, which gives
the actual geometric position of the body along the orbit.
</p>

<h2>7. Physical Interpretation</h2>
<p>
Although the mean anomaly has no direct geometric meaning, the mean anomaly at the epoch
encodes the <strong>initial phase</strong> of the orbital motion. It determines where the
body is located along its orbit at the chosen reference time.
</p>

<p>
Different choices of epoch lead to different values of <em>M₀</em> for the same physical
orbit.
</p>

<h2>8. Special and Limiting Cases</h2>

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Condition</th>
        <th>Interpretation</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>e = 0</td>
        <td>Circular orbit; mean anomaly equals true anomaly</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>i = 0°</td>
        <td>Mean anomaly still well defined</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>e ≥ 1</td>
        <td>Mean anomaly at epoch not defined (non-periodic orbit)</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<h2>9. Applications</h2>
<p>
The mean anomaly at the epoch is essential in:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Orbit propagation and ephemeris computation</li>
    <li>Planetary and asteroid orbit catalogs (e.g., MPCORB)</li>
    <li>Numerical integration and initial condition specification</li>
    <li>Astrodynamics and mission analysis</li>
</ul>

<h2>10. Concise Scientific Definition</h2>
<p>
<strong>The mean anomaly at the epoch</strong> is the value of the mean anomaly specified
at a chosen reference time. It defines the orbital phase of a body at that epoch and
serves as the starting point for time propagation of Keplerian motion.
