<h1>Minor Axis</h1>

<h2>1. Geometrical Definition</h2>
<p>
The <strong>minor axis</strong> is a fundamental geometric concept associated with conic sections, in particular
with the <strong>ellipse</strong>. It is defined as the <em>shortest straight line segment</em> that passes through
the center of the ellipse and connects two opposite points on the curve.
</p>

<p>
The endpoints of the minor axis are the points at which the ellipse reaches its minimum extent. The midpoint of
the minor axis coincides with the geometric center of the ellipse.
</p>

<h2>2. Relation to Semi-Axes</h2>
<p>
An ellipse is characterized by two mutually perpendicular principal axes:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><em>a</em>: the <strong>semi major axis</strong></li>
    <li><em>b</em>: the <strong>semi minor axis</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>
The total length of the minor axis is therefore:
</p>

<span class="formula">
Minor axis length = 2b
</span>

<p>
The minor axis is orthogonal to the major axis and defines the direction of minimum spatial extent of the ellipse.
</p>

<h2>3. Mathematical Description</h2>

<h3>3.1 Ellipse in Cartesian Coordinates</h3>
<p>
For an ellipse centered at the origin and aligned with the coordinate axes, the standard equation is:
</p>

<span class="formula">
(x² / a²) + (y² / b²) = 1
</span>

<p>
In this formulation, the minor axis lies along the coordinate axis associated with the smaller denominator
(<em>b²</em>), indicating the direction of minimal extension.
</p>

<h3>3.2 Relation to Foci and Eccentricity</h3>
<p>
The foci of an ellipse lie along the major axis. If <em>c</em> denotes the distance from the center of the ellipse
to either focus, then the fundamental geometric relationship holds:
</p>

<span class="formula">
b² = a² − c²
</span>

<p>
The <strong>eccentricity</strong> <em>e</em> of the ellipse is defined as:
</p>

<span class="formula">
e = c / a
</span>

<p>
Thus, the semi minor axis can be expressed as:
</p>

<span class="formula">
b = a √(1 − e²)
</span>

<p>
This relation shows that the minor axis is uniquely determined by the semi major axis and the eccentricity.
</p>

<h2>4. Physical Significance in Celestial Mechanics</h2>

<h3>4.1 Keplerian Orbits</h3>
<p>
In classical celestial mechanics, bound orbits are elliptical, with the central body located at one focus.
The minor axis of the orbital ellipse represents the direction of minimum transverse extent of the orbit.
</p>

<p>
Although the minor axis itself is not a standard orbital element, it is directly related to the geometry of the
orbit and the area enclosed by it.
</p>

<h3>4.2 Orbital Area</h3>
<p>
The area <em>A</em> of an elliptical orbit is given by:
</p>

<span class="formula">
A = π a b
</span>

<p>
The minor axis therefore contributes directly to the total orbital area and to the application of Kepler’s
second law.
</p>

    <tr>
        <td>Highly elongated ellipse</td>
        <td>Minor axis approaches zero</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<h2>6. Applications</h2>
<p>
The concept of the minor axis is relevant in many scientific and technical fields, including:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Analytical geometry</li>
    <li>Astrodynamics and orbital mechanics</li>
    <li>Geodesy and planetary reference ellipsoids</li>
    <li>Statistics (e.g., covariance and confidence ellipses)</li>
</ul>

<h2>7. Concise Scientific Definition</h2>
<p>
<strong>The minor axis</strong> of an ellipse is the shortest line segment passing through its center and connecting
two opposite points on the curve. Its length equals twice the semi minor axis and defines the minimum spatial
extent of the ellipse.
