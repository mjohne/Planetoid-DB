<h1>Mean Orbital Speed</h1>

<h2>1. Conceptual Definition</h2>
<p>
The <strong>mean orbital speed</strong> is a derived kinematic quantity in
<strong>celestial mechanics</strong> that represents the average speed of an orbiting
body over one complete orbital revolution.
</p>

<p>
It is defined as the ratio of the total path length of the orbit to the orbital period
and must be distinguished from instantaneous orbital speed, which varies continuously
along non-circular trajectories.
</p>

<h2>2. Formal Definition</h2>
<p>
For a bound Keplerian orbit, the mean orbital speed <strong>v̄</strong> is defined as:
</p>

<span class="formula">
v̄ = P / T
</span>

<p>
where:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><em>P</em> is the orbital perimeter (total path length)</li>
    <li><em>T</em> is the orbital period</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Circular Orbit as a Special Case</h2>
<p>
For a circular orbit of radius <em>r</em>, the orbital perimeter is <em>2πr</em> and the
orbital period is given by Kepler’s third law. The mean orbital speed therefore equals
the instantaneous speed everywhere along the orbit:
</p>

<span class="formula">
v̄ = √( μ / r )
</span>

<h2>4. Elliptical Orbits</h2>
<p>
For elliptical orbits, the instantaneous orbital speed varies according to the
<strong>vis-viva equation</strong>:
</p>

<span class="formula">
v = √( μ ( 2/r − 1/a ) )
</span>

<p>
The mean orbital speed, however, is obtained by averaging over the entire path and can
be written as:
</p>

<span class="formula">
v̄ = (4a E(e)) / T
</span>

<p>
where <em>E(e)</em> is the complete elliptic integral of the second kind.
</p>

<h2>5. Approximate Expression</h2>
<p>
Using accurate approximations for the orbital perimeter, a commonly used approximation
for mean orbital speed is:
</p>

<span class="formula">
v̄ ≈ 2πa (1 − e² / 4) / T
</span>

<p>
This approximation is valid for low to moderate eccentricities.
</p>

<h2>6. Relation to Other Orbital Speeds</h2>
<p>
Mean orbital speed must be clearly distinguished from:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Perihelion speed</strong> (maximum instantaneous speed)</li>
    <li><strong>Aphelion speed</strong> (minimum instantaneous speed)</li>
    <li><strong>Major orbital speed</strong> (characteristic speed at semi-major axis)</li>
</ul>

<div class="note">
The mean orbital speed has no direct dynamical significance but is useful as a global
average descriptor.
</div>

<h2>7. Physical Interpretation</h2>
<p>
The mean orbital speed represents the average distance traveled per unit time over one
orbit. It does not obey simple conservation laws and does not uniquely characterize
the orbital dynamics.
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, it provides a convenient scalar measure for comparing different orbits.
</p>

<h2>8. Applicability and Limitations</h2>
<p>
Mean orbital speed is defined only for:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Closed, bound orbits (elliptical or circular)</li>
</ul>

<div class="note">
For parabolic and hyperbolic trajectories, the mean orbital speed is undefined, as no
finite orbital period or perimeter exists.
</div>

<h2>9. Applications</h2>
<p>
Mean orbital speed is used in:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Educational treatments of orbital motion</li>
    <li>Comparative analysis of orbital trajectories</li>
    <li>Simplified modeling and visualization</li>
    <li>Order-of-magnitude estimates of orbital motion</li>
</ul>

<h2>10. Concise Scientific Definition</h2>
<p>
<strong>The mean orbital speed</strong> is the total length of a closed orbital path
divided by the orbital period. It represents the average speed of an orbiting body over
one full revolution and is a derived, non-fundamental quantity in orbital mechanics.
