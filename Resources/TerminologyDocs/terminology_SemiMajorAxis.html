<h1>Semi Major Axis</h1>

<h2>1. Geometrical Definition</h2>
<p>
The <strong>semi major axis</strong>, commonly denoted by the symbol <em>a</em>, is the most important geometric
parameter of an <strong>ellipse</strong>. An ellipse is defined as the locus of all points in a plane for which the
sum of the distances to two fixed points, known as the <em>foci</em>, is constant.
</p>

<p>
An ellipse possesses two mutually perpendicular principal axes:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Semi major axis (<em>a</em>)</strong>: half of the longest diameter of the ellipse</li>
    <li><strong>Semi minor axis (<em>b</em>)</strong>: half of the shortest diameter of the ellipse</li>
</ul>

<p>
The semi major axis lies along the direction of maximum extent of the ellipse, passes through its center, and
connects the two vertices located farthest apart.
</p>

<h2>2. Mathematical Formulation</h2>

<h3>2.1 Cartesian Equation of an Ellipse</h3>
<p>
For an ellipse centered at the origin and aligned with the coordinate axes, the standard Cartesian equation is:
</p>

<span class="formula">
(x&sup2; / a&sup2;) + (y&sup2; / b&sup2;) = 1
</span>

<p>
In this representation, the semi major axis <em>a</em> determines the scale of the ellipse along its principal
(long) direction.
</p>

<h3>2.2 Relation to Foci and Eccentricity</h3>
<p>
Let <em>c</em> denote the distance from the center of the ellipse to either focus. The fundamental geometric
relationship between the ellipse parameters is:
</p>

<span class="formula">
a&sup2; = b&sup2; + c&sup2;
</span>

<p>
The <strong>eccentricity</strong> <em>e</em> is defined as the ratio:
</p>

<span class="formula">
e = c / a
</span>

<p>
Thus, the semi major axis may be expressed as:
</p>

<span class="formula">
a = c / e
</span>

<p>
for any non-circular ellipse (<em>e &ne; 0</em>). The semi major axis therefore governs the overall size of the ellipse,
while the eccentricity controls its shape.
</p>

<h2>3. Physical Significance in Celestial Mechanics</h2>

<h3>3.1 Keplerian Orbits</h3>
<p>
In classical celestial mechanics, the motion of two bodies interacting via Newtonian gravitation results in a
conic section. For bound systems, this conic section is an ellipse with the central mass located at one focus.
</p>

<p>
In this context, the semi major axis <em>a</em> is the most fundamental orbital element:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>It determines the characteristic size of the orbit</li>
    <li>It is directly related to the specific orbital energy</li>
    <li>It controls the orbital period via Kepler&rsquo;s third law</li>
</ul>

<h3>3.2 Orbital Energy and Period</h3>
<p>
For a body of negligible mass orbiting a central mass with standard gravitational parameter <em>&mu;</em>, the
specific orbital energy <em>&#949;</em> is given by:
</p>

<span class="formula">
&#949; = &minus; &mu; / (2a)
</span>

<p>
The orbital period <em>T</em> of a bound Keplerian orbit is:
</p>

<span class="formula">
T = 2&pi; &#8730;(a&sup3; / &mu;)
</span>

<p>
These relations highlight that the semi major axis uniquely determines both the energy state and the temporal
scale of the orbit.
</p>

        <td>e &gt; 1</td>
        <td>Hyperbola</td>
        <td>a is negative (unbound orbit)</td>
    </tr>

<h2>5. Applications</h2>
<p>
The semi major axis is a central parameter in many scientific and engineering disciplines, including:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Orbital mechanics and astrodynamics</li>
    <li>Planetary science and exoplanet characterization</li>
    <li>Satellite mission design and trajectory analysis</li>
    <li>Geodesy and reference ellipsoids</li>
</ul>

<h2>6. Concise Scientific Definition</h2>
<p>
<strong>The semi major axis</strong> is defined as half the length of the longest diameter of an ellipse. In
gravitational two-body dynamics, it represents the fundamental measure of orbital size and is directly related to
the system&rsquo;s total mechanical energy and orbital period.
